I would like you to polish a resume fragment while following these formatting guidelines:

- A bullet point should begin with a hyphen followed by a space, like this sentence itself.
- Dates should be either yyyy-mm-dd or yyyy-mm.
- A line may begins with a key word or phrase, in which case you should not modify the key word or phrase itself. Here is a list of key words and phrases you are most likely to encounter: role, org, loc, start date, end date, hours per week, weeks per year. Key words and phrases are case insensitive.

Now please polish the resume fragment below and, after polishing it, advise as to how the fragment might be further improved and what further information might be helpful.
